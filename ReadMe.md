This repository contains a series of simple, incremental API projects developed while learning the Go programming language. The focus is on:

* Understanding how to set up a basic HTTP server in Go
* Creating RESTful endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
* Working with routing libraries like `net/http` and `gorilla/mux`
* Implementing middleware (logging, CORS, etc.)
* Connecting to databases (e.g., PostgreSQL or SQLite)
* Structuring code in a scalable way
* Using environment variables and `.env` files
* Writing basic unit tests

## ðŸš§ What Iâ€™m Learning

* [x] HTTP server basics
* [x] Routing and path parameters
* [x] JSON encoding/decoding
* [x] HTTP methods & status codes
* [ ] Authentication & authorization
* [ ] Error handling patterns
* [ ] Testing APIs
* [ ] Dockerizing a Go API

## ðŸ“¦ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Avadhoot1905/Golang-api.git
   cd Golang-api
   ```

2. Run the project:

   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

3. Use a tool like Postman or cURL to test the endpoints.

## ðŸ§  Inspiration

This project is inspired by:

* Go by Example
* Traversy Media tutorials
* Golang documentation
* Building practical backend skills
